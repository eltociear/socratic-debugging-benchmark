<problem>
Create a method `removeEven(nums:List[int]) -> List[int]` that accepts a list `nums`. Remove all even numbers from `nums` and return a list without any even numbers.

## Example Cases:
```
removeEven([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) => [1,3,5,7,9]
removeEven([2,4,6,8,10]) => []
removeEven([1,3,5,7,9]) => [1,3,5,7,9]
removeEven([-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10]) => []
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def removeEven(nums):
2.  newNums = []
3.  for i in nums
4.    if i % 2 != 0:
5.      newNums.append(i)
6.  return newNums
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is a syntax error on line 3. The for loop syntax is incorrect.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Add `:` after `nums` on line 3.

User: Hi, I am not sure why my program for removing even numbers is not running. Can you please help?
	<alt>Hi, my program for removing even numbers is throwing an error. Can you help me understand the error?
Assistant: Hi, Sure! It looks like your program has a syntax error on line 3, do you know what that means?
	<alt>Hi, Sure! Do you know why it is throwing a syntax error on line 3?
User: Does it mean that my expression on line 3 is not following the rules on how the for loop should be written?
Assistant: Yes, can you use the caret in your output to figure out what is wrong with your syntax?
User: It looks like there is something wrong towards the end of line 3, but I am not sure what that is.
Assistant: Can use the documentation to figure out the syntax of a for loop?
	<alt>It looks like you are missing a punctuation mark, do you know what that is?
User: Am I missing a colon at the end?
Assistant: Yes, you need to include that colon at the end of line 3.
User: This code now works, thank you for your help!
