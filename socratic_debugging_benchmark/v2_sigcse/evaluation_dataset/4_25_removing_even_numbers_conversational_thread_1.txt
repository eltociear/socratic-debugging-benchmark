<problem>
Create a method `removeEven(nums:List[int]) -> List[int]` that accepts a list `nums`. Remove all even numbers from `nums` and return a list without any even numbers.

## Example Cases:
```
removeEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
removeEven([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) => []
removeEven([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
removeEven([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) => [9, -1, 7]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def removeEven(nums):
2.    newNums = []
3.    for i in nums:
4.        if i % 2 != 0:
5.            newNums.append(i)
6. return newNums
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is a syntax error on line 6. The return statement is not within a function scope.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert a tab indentation before `return newNums` on line 6.

assert removeEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert removeEven([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == []
assert removeEven([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert removeEven([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) == [9, -1, 7]

User: Hi! I implemented my method but it throws a syntax error that says my return statement is outside the function. Can you help me resolve this?
	<alt>Hi! I am working on the method to remove even numbers, but it is not running because of line 6. Can you help me find out what is wrong here?
Assistant: Let's warm up by thinking about what the "scope" of a code block means. Do you know what that is and how that might affect a "return" statement?
	<alt>I'm here to help! Let's think about what this error might mean. Do you know what might be causing it?
	<alt>Sure, let's look at the error together. Do you know what the error "SyntaxError: 'return' outside function" means?
User: The scope refers to the visibility of a certain variable depending on where it has been used. For example, a variable defined inside a function is only visible to the function, and cannot be used outside the function.
	<alt>The scope means certain variables can only be used within the visibility of the code block they are a part of.
Assistant: That's right. Let's look back at your code now. Is the return statement in the correct scope?
	<alt>Right, so how would you indent line 6 so that it is part of the method?
User: I would need to indent it so that it is inside the function. I will make changes now.
